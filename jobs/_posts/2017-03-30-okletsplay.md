I managed the software development team of a patented esports tournament and
cash match platform for mobile, desktop, and web. I helped make crucial
decisions, facilitated safe conversations, interfaced with advisors and
investors, sourced and recruited developers, and wore every engineering hat
necessary.

After having built the initial front-end and distributed back-end myself, we
grew the team and I ultimately focused most on team and project management, as
well as partner relations. We used ClojureScript + React on the front-end and
Clojure + Ring on the back-end. All services were Dockerized and all IO to/from
Postgres, Mongo, and other external sources was scheduled by core.async.
