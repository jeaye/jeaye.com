I managed the software development team of a patented esports tournament and
cash match platform for mobile, desktop, and web. I helped make crucial
decisions, facilitated safe conversations, interfaced with advisors and
investors, sourced and recruited developers, and wore every engineering hat
necessary. I managed the product goals and roadmap, including market research
and partner relations. As we grew our player base, I also managed our community,
including research, outreach, and support.

After having built the initial front-end and distributed back-end, we grew the
team and I ultimately focused primarily on team and project management, as well
as partner relations. We used ClojureScript & React on the front-end and Clojure
& Ring on the back-end. All services were Dockerized and all IO to/from
Postgres, Mongo, and other external sources was scheduled by core.async.
