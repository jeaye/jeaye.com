I lead the development of a patented e-sports wagering platform for mobile, console, and web. I help make crucial decisions, facilitate safe conversations, interface with advisors and investors, and wear every engineering hat necessary.

Our front-end is developed with ClojureScript and React Native and our back-end is running Clojure on Heroku.
