I lead the development of a patented esports tournament and cash match platform
for mobile, desktop, console, and web. I help make crucial decisions, facilitate
safe conversations, interface with advisors and investors, and wear every
engineering hat necessary.

We use ClojureScript + React on the front-end and Clojure + Ring on the
back-end. All services are Dockerized and all IO to/from Postgres, Mongo, and
other external sources is scheduled by core.async.
