I was a founding member of the core game engine team at TinyCo. We had the opportunity to not only instill better practices, such as continuous integration and daily code reviewing, but also do a great deal of systems-level API work in modern C++. I developed and integrated a replacement notification system using template meta-programming, which was much more thread-safe and type-safe. During my time at TinyCo, I also reimplemented the texture loading, on Android and iOS, to work asynchronously, using modern C++ synchronization.

The systems I implemented and the APIs I maintained were the core of hit games including Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff, Tiny Monsters, and more; these games manage ~100 million installs across Android and iOS.

I gave multiple talks to the engineering department, covering modern C++ techniques and features, using modern C++ synchronization for threading, and using template meta-programming for type-rich interfaces.

The culture at TinyCo was competitive, yet collaborative; we had many discussions and debates about C++ best practices and architecture design either during review or lunch time talks. At the end of the day, the code was cleaner and better maintained because of our passion.
