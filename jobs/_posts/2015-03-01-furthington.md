I was the lead developer on multiple Android and iOS games, covering the client-side game play as well as implementing the entire back end. All client-side work was done using Unity3D; I spent a great deal of time working in C#, designing type-safe, asynchronous APIs. The back end work was all done in C++14, using Crow, a multi-threaded micro web framework for modern C++.

Some interesting systems I designed and implemented include a type-safe notification system and a procedural music generator using common Jazz progressions and Markov chains.
