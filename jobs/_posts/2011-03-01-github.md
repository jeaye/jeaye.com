I have been actively developing open source software for several years. Many of my own projects, ranging from game engines and systems-level C++ libraries, to unit testing frameworks and Vim plug-ins, are used by thousands each day. Along with providing support for them, I also have contributed to a number of other projects which are not mine. Some of these include Rust, Clojure, NixOS, Reagent, Fail2Ban, OpenMW, and many more.

In other projects, though I may not merge my own commits, I help the community by reviewing code which others have committed or reporting issues and troubleshooting their causes. The competitive, yet amazingly collaborative environment which is the open source world, be it on Github or in IRC, is a place where passionate developers can certainly thrive; I love being a part of it.
