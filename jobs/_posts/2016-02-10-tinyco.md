I was a member of the Marvel: Avenger's Academy game team and worked on a variety of tasks, in modern C++, ranging from implementing game features and UI per spec to improving core systems, such as the multi-threaded downloader. I had the opportunity to research, profile, and improve the game's load times by over 40%.

Always with safety in mind, I gave talks on functional programming and the intricacies of C++ value categories, pushed for regular code reviews, and mentored others to achieve more maintainable code.
