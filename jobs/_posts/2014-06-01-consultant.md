I built upon an existing, and well-proven, game engine utilizing cocos2d-x to integrate 3D rendering support using Ogre3D. The target platforms were Android NDK and iOS, using modern C++, which required profiling of the renderer to achieve good performance.

I enjoyed working remotely for the whole duration of the project; it was an exciting challenge to quickly learn how to manage remote work and improve communication with detailed write ups and daily check-ins with the project lead.
